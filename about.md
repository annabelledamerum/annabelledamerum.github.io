Iâ€™m a PhD-trained research scientist working at the intersection of bioinformatics, microbiome science, and epidemiology. I build reproducible NGS workflows (Nextflow), analyze large-scale metagenomic datasets, and and communicate results to clinical, academic, and public health partners.

**Interests:** wastewater pathogen surveillance, antimicrobial resistance prediction, de novo assembly and functional annotation, and accessible analysis tooling.
