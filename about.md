Iâ€™m a PhD-trained research scientist working at the intersection of bioinformatics, microbiome science, and epidemiology. I build reproducible NGS workflows (Nextflow), analyze large-scale metagenomic datasets, and and communicate results to clinical, academic, and public health partners.

**Current Research Interests:** wastewater pathogen surveillance, antimicrobial resistance prediction, de novo assembly and functional annotation, and accessible analysis tooling.

I am a first-generation college student from a small town in the middle of England (literally "the Midlands") called Daventry. I started out my scientific training at the University of Newcastle in the North-East of England, where I studied Applied Biology. I had completed Biology, Physics and Psychology A-levels and to be quite honest, stumbled into a Biology degree thinking "its a STEM subject and is easier than physics"! During an Introduction to Plant Biology lecture in my second year, Professor Jerry Barnes gave a lecture on crop biotechnology, using "Golden rice" as an example. Golden rice is rice which has been genetically modified to produce beta-carotene, a pre-cursor to vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to blindness in children, and this biofortified food staple was intended to improve vitamin A consumption in countries where micronutrient deficiency is prevalent. From that moment I was hooked. You mean - we can alter the genetics of this staple food crop, creating a rice 2.0 which can stop children who do not have access to a balanced diet from going blind?! 
I very quickly shifted my focus from "Biology" to "Applied Biology", taking all the genetics, genomics and biotechnology classes I could. For my final year dissertation I had the pleasure of working in the lab of Professor Angharad Gatehouse, where I investigated the antioxidant properties of maize plants biofortified via particle bombardment of callus cells to express beta-carotene, ascorbate and folate (for the original paper, see PMID: 19416835). My passion for this project won me the "Clark and Young Prize for Outstanding Academic Achievement" and set me off on a path towards plant biotechnology.
I decided I liked being in the lab and I wanted to develop my wet lab skills, so I next started a Master of Research (MRes) at Imperial College, London. I was attracted to Imperial College due to it's status, it's excellent program for "Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology", and because I was able to live rent-free with my extremely kind sister and brother-in-law! It was an extrememly challenging yet rewarding year comprising two lab rotations, each with a dissertation and a final *viva voce*. My first rotation was in the lab of Professor Peter Nixon, where I investigated proteins comprising photosystem II; the first protein complex which captures photons and catalyzes the conversion of water into oxygen. In this rotation I learnt a host of fundamental skills including: bacterial culturing and transformation, protein overexpression and purification, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and even (unsuccessful) attempts at protein crystallography. During my second rotation, in the lab of Professor Pietro Spanu and under the excellent guidance of Dr Helen Pennington (then an extremely patient graduate student), I put many of these freshly acquired skills to the test, investigating the host-pathogen interactions of barley and the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (*Blumeria graminis*). A previous study had identified a handful of *B. graminis* proteins which were associated with host barley cells colonized with haustoria - parasitic fungal hyphae which penetrate the host cell, through which molecules are exchanged.
