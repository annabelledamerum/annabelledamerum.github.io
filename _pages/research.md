Below are representative projects. Figures are illustrative—see Publications for details.

### 1) Wastewater pathogen surveillance platforms
Reproducible pipelines for bacterial/viral/protozoan pathogen detection from municipal wastewater: whole-metagenome shotgun for multi-kingdom profiling, hybrid probe capture for low-abundance viruses, tiled and targeted amplicon sequencing for variant tracking, and clinical–wastewater comparative genomics for epidemiology.

### 2) Machine learning for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prediction
Supervised models (RF, GBM, SVM, linear) trained on NGS-derived features. Best practices include cross-validation and class imbalance handling.

### 3) Long-read assembly & MAG quality
Benchmarking long-read metagenome assembly, binning, and consolidation methods for accurate metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and downstream functional analysis.

### 4) Clinical & veterinary diagnostics via NGS
End-to-end bioinformatics and interpretation workflows transforming metagenomic reads into actionable reports for clinicians and veterinarians.

### 5) Methylation profiling (ONT) for epigenetic signatures
Detection of modified bases (4mC/5mC/6mA) and motif-level differentially methylated sites to distinguish different bacterial strains.

### 6) Plant genomics & quantitative genetics
De novo genome assembly, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for traits including nutritional quality and water-use efficiency; CRISPR-Cas genome editing functional validation of identified candidates; population genomics in a variety of food and non-food crops.

### 7) Custom analytics highlights
- **Fig cultivar relatedness** (nf-core/sarek, bcftools/vcftools, PLINK IBD).  
- **Bladder cancer cystectomy microbiome** and post-operative outcomes.  
- **Bacterial Dysbiosis Index** for vaginal microbiome (marker-gene sequencing).  
- **Implant topography & biofilm formation** and wound healing.
